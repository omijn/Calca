Possible syntax errors (by user)
- expressions starting with operators (+, -, /, *, =)

- multiple operators appearing together

- handling multiple decimal points in a number



NOTE - remember to handle negative numbers



Other special conditions
- after result of operation is displayed, if another number/decimal is pressed -> clear TextView
					else if operator -> append 

- if only decimal point is pressed, and then another number, consider it as 0.number

- if = sign is pressed -> do nothing/ display number itself

- if two operators appear consecutively, don't accept the second operator (unless it's -/.)

- keep 0s at the beginning of a number (AND extra 0s at the end of a decimal point)
